# IrisData_Project
Programming and Scripting module - Project on the Iris dataset

*By: Mohamed Noor - 2018*

## Introduction
This project related to the Fisher's Iris dataset, as obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [webpage snapshot](UCI Machine Learning Repository_ Iris Data Set.pdf).

To analyze the dataset (in statistics term: exploratory data analysis), a script was written in Python 3.6.3 with Visual Studio Community 2017. The main and other well-known libraries were utilized to read the Iris dataset and output the analysis results.
(see the following section below).

An extensive search was made on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), (Python documentation)[https://docs.python.org/3/] and Google in general to determine the best strategy for writing a relatively flexible, OS-independent script.

Briefly, in terms of the Iris dataset itself, the dataset captures the measurements of *Iris* flowers (sepal and petal lengths and widths, all in cm) and the respective *Iris* species (*I. setosa*, *I. versicolor* and *I. virginica*), and was used by Ronald Fisher in his [paper [R.A. Fisher (1936) 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems', Annals of Eugenics, 7: 179-188. doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x]](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x). Interestingly, note that the journal's name was changed to Annals of Human Genetics for bad connotations of the eugenics field. There is more information on (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set].

In the machine learning field, this dataset can be used to train different statistical algorithms and perform a prediction on which species a set of flower measurements belong to.

Some images to give a background - all images were taken from the (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set] page, and are confirmed to be freely shareable.
