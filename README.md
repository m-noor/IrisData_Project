# IrisData_Project
Programming and Scripting module - Project on the Iris dataset

*By: Mohamed Noor - 2018*

## Introduction
This project related to the Fisher's Iris dataset, as obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [webpage snapshot](UCI Machine Learning Repository_ Iris Data Set.pdf).

To analyze the dataset (in statistics term: exploratory data analysis), a script was written in Python 3.6.3 with Visual Studio Community 2017. The main and other well-known libraries were utilized to read the Iris dataset and output the analysis results.
(see the following section below).

An extensive search was made on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), (Python documentation)[https://docs.python.org/3/] and Google in general to determine the best strategy for writing a relatively flexible, OS-independent script.

Briefly, in terms of the Iris dataset itself, the dataset captures the measurements of *Iris* flowers (sepal and petal lengths and widths, all in cm) and the respective *Iris* species (*I. setosa*, *I. versicolor* and *I. virginica*), and was used by Ronald Fisher in his paper [R.A. Fisher (1936) 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems', Annals of Eugenics, 7: 179-188. doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x]


This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. 

This is an exceedingly simple domain. 


1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. class: 
-- Iris Setosa 
-- Iris Versicolour 
-- Iris Virginica
